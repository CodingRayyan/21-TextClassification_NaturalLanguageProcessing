# NLP-Text Classification (TF-IDF)

## 1. Introduction to NLP
Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a field of artificial intelligence that focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. It combines computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning techniques to process and analyze text data efficiently.

## 2. Key NLP Techniques
Some of the fundamental techniques used in NLP include:
- Tokenization
- Stopword Removal
- Stemming and Lemmatization
- Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Part-of-Speech (POS) Tagging
- Text Vectorization (BoW, TF-IDF, Word Embeddings)

## 3. Overview of NLP Tools
Several popular tools and libraries facilitate NLP tasks, including:
- **NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)** – A comprehensive library for NLP tasks such as tokenization, stemming, and parsing.
- **spaCy** – A fast and efficient NLP library with pre-trained models.
- **Scikit-learn** – Provides ML models and utilities for text vectorization (BoW, TF-IDF).
- **TensorFlow/Keras** – Used for deep learning-based NLP tasks.
- **Gensim** – Specializes in topic modeling and word embeddings.

## 4. Challenges in NLP
NLP faces several challenges, including:
- **Ambiguity** – Words and sentences may have multiple meanings.
- **Data Sparsity** – Limited labeled data for training models.
- **Context Understanding** – Difficulty in understanding the meaning of words in different contexts.
- **Language Diversity** – Variations in grammar, dialects, and slang.
- **Computational Complexity** – Large datasets and deep learning models require significant resources.

## 5. Bag of Words (BoW) – Simplest Word Embedding Technique
The **Bag of Words (BoW)** model converts text into numerical features by counting word occurrences, disregarding grammar and word order. It creates a document-term matrix where each row represents a document and each column represents a unique word.

## 6. TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
**TF-IDF** is an improvement over BoW that assigns importance to words based on their frequency in a document and across all documents. It helps reduce the impact of common words while emphasizing rare and meaningful terms.

## 7. Loading Spam Dataset
The dataset used in this project is a spam classification dataset containing labeled text messages as **spam** or **ham** (not spam). It is loaded using **pandas**.

## 8. Text Preprocessing

- Text preprocessing includes:
- Converting text to lowercase
- Removing special characters and punctuation
- Tokenization
- Stopword removal
- Stemming or Lemmatization

## 9. Pairplot (Data Visualization)
Pairplots help visualize relationships between features and target labels.

## 10. Train-Test Split
The dataset is split into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance.

## Conclusion
This repository provides an in-depth guide to NLP-based text classification using TF-IDF. It covers fundamental concepts, data preprocessing, and model training. Future improvements may include implementing deep learning-based NLP models such as LSTMs and Transformers.
